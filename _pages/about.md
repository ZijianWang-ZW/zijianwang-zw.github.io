Biography
======
Dr. Zijian Wang (王资健) is an independent postdoctoral researcher at the TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute (GNI). He obtained his PhD from Technion Israel Institute of Technology as a Marie Curie Early-Stage Researcher in the [Cloud BIM (CBIM) project](https://cbim2020.net.technion.ac.il/), funded by the EU Horizon 2020 program (November 2020 – January 2024). He worked under the supervision of [Prof. Rafael Sacks](https://sacks.net.technion.ac.il/). Before that, he completed a master’s degree in Computer and Machine Vision at Cranfield University (2019–2020) and a second master’s in Civil Engineering at Central South University. He received his bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from Chongqing Jiaotong University (2014–2018). He has also visited the University of Cambridge as a researcher (2022) and worked at Trimble Finland (2023).

As an interdisciplinary researcher with expertise in both civil engineering and machine learning, he is dedicated to advancing digitalization in the construction industry through the application of advanced computer science techniques.

Current Research: Building Information Graphs (BIGs)
======

BIGs aim to adopt graphs as an alternative information modeling method to support graph learning and graph applications. Graphs inherently capture relationships explicitly between objects, enabling a more detailed, object-level data representation. Graphs are also flexible in representing and embedding multi-modal data in a machine-accessible format, enabling computational learning. By transforming design information into graphs, BIGs could enable a variety of innovative graph applications that current BIM technologies struggle to support, such as multidisciplinary change propagation, automated consistency maintenance, object-based version control, and more. This approach has the potential to foster a more collaborative, intelligent, and generative future in design.
