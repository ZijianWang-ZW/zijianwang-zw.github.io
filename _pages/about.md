Zijian Wang (王资健) is a Ph.D. candidate at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, where he works at VClab with [Prof. Rafael Sacks](https://sacks.net.technion.ac.il/). He is also a Marie-Curie early-stage researcher in the [CBIM project](https://cbim2020.net.technion.ac.il/) received funding from EU Horizon 2020 (since November 2020). Before that, he obtained his master's degree in computer and machine vision from Cranfield University (2019 - 2022), advised by [Dr. Yifan Zhao](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/people/dr-yifan-zhao-1337015). He received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering (underground and tunnel engineering) from Chongqing Jiaotong University, where he visited Nagaoka University of Technology in Japan and Thammasat University in Thailand (2014 - 2018). 

As an interdisciplinary researcher, he has strong background in both civil engineering and computer vision, and desires to promote the digitalization of construction industry by applying advanced computer science techniques. 






Research Interests
======
**Graph in BIM.** We, the CBIM Technion research team, explore what the next generation of BIM is. Our answer is Cloud-based BIM (CBIM). My research is to test the most fundamental framework and techniques of CBIM -- graph representation of BIM models and semantic enrichment for BIM graphs. From a BIM view, my work is to explore all possible AI techniques to enrich BIM semantics, including inferring implicit BIM objects, BIM relationships, and across-domain BIM links. From a computer science view, I am dealing with graph node classification, single graph link prediction, multiple graph link prediction tasks by using graph neural networks (GNN), deep learning, and machine learning.
