## Overview

Even with modern BIM software, design collaboration across disciplines for building construction remains sequential and siloed. Cloud-based BIM (CBIM) proposes an alternative approach, in which BIM models are stored as discipline-specific graphs whose nodes are linked to support across-domain coordination.

## Key Contributions

- Defined constraint classes to relate objects across disciplines
- Devised a mechanism to resolve conflicts
- Implemented a case study prototype with federated building models
- Demonstrated system's response to design changes across disciplines

We are persistently delving into the potential of representing BIM models as graphs, and firmly believe that BIM graphs can enable more advanced and intelligent applications in the future.
